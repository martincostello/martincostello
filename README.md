### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Martin, and I'm a software developer and tester based near London.

I've been working in software development since 2006. My experience is primarily with C# and ASP.NET and related technologies, as well Cloud infrastructure on Azure and AWS. I've also been a [Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies](https://martincostello.com/mvp "My MVP profile") since 2019.

Sometimes I blog about programming stuff [on my blog](https://blog.martincostello.com/ "My blog").

### Projects

As well as my own projects, some of which are pinned below, I also contribute to other parts of the open source ecosystem.

I help maintain the projects of the [aspnet-contrib](https://github.com/aspnet-contrib "The aspnet-contrib org on GitHub.com") organization, [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly), and sometimes contribute to the projects for .NET and ASP.NET Core.

### Contact

If you want to contact me about something outside the scope of GitHub Issues within one of my repositories, you can find me [on Bluesky](https://martincostello.com/bluesky "My Bluesky profile") ðŸ¦‹, as well as via the email associated with my Git commits ðŸ“§.
