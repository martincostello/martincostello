### Hi there üëã

My name is Martin, and I'm a software developer and tester based in London. I'm currently a Principal Engineer at [Just Eat Takeaway.com](https://github.com/justeattakeaway "The Just Eat Takeaway.com org on GitHub").

I've been working in software development since 2006. My experience is primarily with C# and ASP.NET and related technologies, as well Cloud infrastructure on Azure and AWS. I've also been a [Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies]( https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003438 "My MVP profile") since 2019.

Sometimes I blog about programming stuff on my blog at [blog.martincostello.com](https://blog.martincostello.com/ "My blog").

### Projects

As well as my own projects, some of which are pinned below, I also contribute to other parts of the open source ecosystem.

I help maintain the projects of the [aspnet-contrib](https://github.com/aspnet-contrib "The aspnet-contrib org on GitHub.com") organization, .NET projects for my employer [Just Eat](https://github.com/justeat "The Just Eat org on GitHub.com"), and sometimes contribute to the projects for .NET and ASP.NET Core.

### Contact
