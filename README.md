### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Martin, and I'm a software developer and tester based near London.

I'm currently a Staff Software Engineer at [Grafana Labs][grafana] working on OpenTelemetry SDKs. ðŸ”­

I've been working in software development since 2006. My experience is primarily with C# and ASP.NET and related technologies, as
well as Cloud infrastructure on Azure and AWS. I've also been a [Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies][mvp] since 2019.

Sometimes I blog about programming stuff [on my blog][blog].

### Projects

As well as my own projects, some of which are pinned below, I also contribute to other parts of the open source ecosystem.

I help maintain the projects of the [aspnet-contrib][aspnet-contrib] organization, [Polly][polly], [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore][swashbuckle], and
sometimes contribute to the projects for .NET and ASP.NET Core.
